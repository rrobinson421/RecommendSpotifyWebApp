# Spotify Recommendation Web Application Project
Current personal project meant to create an alternative way of finding song recommendendations using the SpotifyAPI and Spotipy in the form of a web application.

# Created With:
**Languages:** Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
**APIs:** SpotifyAPI, Spotipy

This project is built on Django with the purpose of facilitating Python as a primary language for the back-end, and using HTML and CSS for the front-end of the website itself. JavaScript is seldom used to specifically incorporate more Python usage.

# Purpose:

This project was meant to better sharpen and improve my Python skills while tackling front-end work. The creation of a recommendation application is a tool that I personally would find useful as I dislike Spotify's current recommendation implementations, but I use Spotify so I would like to only receive relvant content to their platform.
